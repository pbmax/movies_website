# movies_website
# This script creates a new Class, called "Movies", that stores information related to a collection of movies. The script uses the rotten_tomatoes method in Python to automatically publish a website with the movies' titles, posters, and trailers.
# To use this, download the entire "movies" file and then run the entertainment_center.py file.
